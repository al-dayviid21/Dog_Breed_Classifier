## Installation
The necessary libraries to run the code here are found <a href=''>requirements.txt</a>. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Summary
This project is a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message that were sent during disaster events and get classification results in several categories so that they can be sent an appropriate disaster relief agency. The web app will also display visualizations of the data pecularities. 

## File Descriptions
The file structure for the project with descriptions are shown below:

## Instructions
1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl`

2. Go to `app` directory: `cd app`

3. Run your web app: `python run.py`

4. Click the `PREVIEW` button to open the homepage
