## Installation
The necessary libraries to run the code here are found <a href='https://github.com/al-dayviid21/Dog_Breed_Classifier/blob/main/requirements.txt'>requirements.txt</a>. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Summary
In this project, a Convolutional Neural Network pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images was built.  Given an image of a dog, the CNN model will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the CNN model will identify the resembling dog breed.
